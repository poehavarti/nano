It was Saturday afternoon and Reggie was fifteen minutes away from my house. 
I was in the bathroom adjusting and readjusting my clothes, tucking my hair behind my ears and pulling it back over them, pulling my shirt to get it to look right. I had never been this hung up on looking perfect before, ever. I'd also never been to a dance before and I'd never had a first impression this big to make. Not that it was really a first impression, I reminded myself. He'd seen my face contorted on Facebook in, I assumed, all 263 of my photos. I'd seen all of his photos. 
Not in a creepy way.
I had put on at least four different combinations of outfits. I didn't own a huge variety of clothing. I mostly just wore band shirts and jeans. Nevertheless, I tried on all three of the pants I liked to see which one made me look the least awkward. I eventually picked the ones that would have been the most expensive had I not gotten them on black Friday the previous year. The shirt I wore was grey and about Radiohead. 
I had cleaned my room, picking up all the granola bar wrappers fron under the bed and dirty holey old socks from inside the closet. I wasn't generally a big mess generator but I did tend to leave things that I was done with laying around rather than throwing them away. 
Now, I'd been in the bathroom for more than fifteen minutes. Looking at myself, making faces, ruffling my hair, brushing it back out, tucking and untucking my shirt (why would I tuck it in anyway? I never did that), and brushing my teeth twice. Finally I decided that it wasn't going to get better than this. I gave myself a final mirror wink and went to leave, just as my phone buzzed. 
"i think i'm on your street," said the text from Reggie.
I hustled down the stairs, passing my mom on the way and calling, "Reggie's here!" with more enthusiasm than I generally tended to have about things. I went out the front door and saw the tan minivan of previously only two dimensional internet pictures coming towards my house. The sun's glare obscured the driver, but it didn't stop the butterflies in my stomach. 
I would have flagged him down or waved or something, but instead I just stood there with wide eyes, paralyzed with anticipation and fear, as Reggie's face got visible through the clear window and he aptly parallel parked on the street. Pauline opened her door and stepped out. I'd said hello to her a few times. She was very nice. She looked a lot like Reggie, but of course, more ladylike and a bit older. She was a sophomore in college this year, but she still lived in her parents' house as she went to school at UCLA, which, in my limited knowledge of Los Angeles' geography, I understood to be not terribly far from Santa Monica, where Reggie's family lived.
"Hey Sam, she said and Reggie's door opened.
"Hi," I said, my voice cracking into a near whisper.
Reggie stepped out of the mom van and closed the door behind him. He looked good, even after having driven all day. His smile was the kind of smile I'd expect the sun to have if it had a face. He was sort of what I pictured the sun being like, actually. I thought that and realized I was ridiculous. But he was so sunny, he was tan and had the mind of muscles you get when you do stuff, not the kind that happened when you "worked out." He surfed, like I assumed you did when you lived a mile from the beach. His hair was brown but had warm gold highlights from the sun. His face was freckled and his cheeks had a kind blush. He was way cuter in person.
I sighed and he beamed and walked towards me with his arms open for a hug. He was warm and comforting and he smelled like good deodorant. I squeezed a little harder than I meant to. His chin hooked around my shoulder, he hugged me tight and said, "I am so happy to see you." What a dreamboat.
"You too," I choked up through the butterflies throwing themselves against the lining of my stomach. He let go. Pauline and I shared a much less enthusiastic hug and I led them inside.
"Hey mom, here's Reggie and Pauline," I said, finding a shred of confidence again.
"Hello," said my mom in a tone that suggested that she, too, thought Reggie was cuter in person. He beamed at her. She got up to give he and Pauline little hugs. "It's very nice to meet you," she said with a genuine smile. 
"You too, Ms. Clark," said Reggie respectfully, still showing off his white teeth. My mom's face was growing warmer by the minute. 
"Well, it's early," Reggie said, keeping things rolling. "Do you think the three of us could go to the mall or something, before the dance?" asked Reggie, half to me and half to my mom. 
"Oh of course," she answered lovingly. "Be back by 6:30 so I can get some pictures of you all before the dance." I nodded and started leaving, leading the siblings out behind me. 
We all got in the car, which had carpety seating and smelled like air fresheners and plastic. Reggie plugged his music player into the wire coming out of the tape jack. "Pick something?" he asked me as we began the seven minute drive to the mall. 
I rifled through his artists list, which, as I knew, was inspiringly good. I picked Radiohead to match my shirt and we longingly moaned along to Kid A while I gave him directions and we took the short journey to the mall. We arrived, Reggie parked, and we all went in. 
Our conversation started off kind of stunted and strange. It was a different setting, being in the same room with him. I was so used to there being a screen between us that it was strange to actually get to be there with him. It was also hard, because right from the start I was battling the urge to kiss his warm face.  
We went to just a few shops but mostly just found ourselves walking through the big open hallways of the mall, joking and laughing and having a merry old time. We tried our best to keep Pauline involved in the conversation, but it was hard. He and I had so much to say to each other and she was just kind of there most of the time. I sort of felt bad, but I was usually the third wheel (or second or fifth or really any number, my awkwardness was the constant) in situations, and I figured I'd have to learn how to get over that myself before I made it my job to help old Pauline. 
We had a really nice hour or so at the mall, just perusing shop windows. We'd poke fun at what the mannequins were wearing and try and imitate the models. To this day there exist several photos of me very aptly interpreting the stance of some lovely emaciated high fashion females. Reggie too, though he committed less to the facial expressions than I did and therefore was not, America's next top model. 
We tried on a few silly getups as well, me in a ladies' sweater with a shimmery cat embroidered to the front, he in a lime green fleece peacoat, jeggings, and nude pumps, pauline in 3XL silk pajamas. We got kicked out of the store with that last one, as Pauline hilariously paraded back and forth across the dressing room, the lacy lavender bottoms falling down around her ankles twice. We had a great time. 

Finally, though, it was time to go home and prepare for the dance. Reggie and Pauline had brought nice things, and I had one nice outfit. Over black jeans I wore my one button down (it was maroon), my dad's black tie, and a sort of nice black jacket. I also donned the red Doc Marten's that I loved too much to wear without a reason. That wasn't really because I doubted their integrity, I didn't, and I honestly was excited for the way they'd look when I broke them in enough to show some wear. But if I wore them once every month or two, when there was a reason for people to look at me, I never, ever got less than four compliments. Sometimes people would just say they liked my shoes, but more often people would say they liked my shoes, and I looked great, and sometimes they'd skip the shoes all together and just tell me I looked hot. I figured if I always looked that good, people would stop noticing. Today was the kind of day that warranted these lucky shoes of mine. Today I wanted Reggie to notice me. 

I let Reggie and Patricia take the bathroom and my bedroom while I changed in my parents' room. I finished changing first, probably because my getup was the least extravagant. I walked out of the downstairs bedroom and showed off to my parents, sitting on the couch in front of the news. "You look great," smiled my dad. My mom agreed, voicing her approval with oohs and aahs. She got up off the couch to give me a big hug. 

"My handsome baby. I couldn't be more proud," she said, arms wrapped around me. I tried not to groan. She might as well be pinching my cheeks! There was a cute boy in the house! Where were her manners!

Reggie emerged from the stairwell, looking just about as dapper as I'd ever seen a person look. He was wearing a navy blue button down with brown suspenders and a red tie. His tight-ish pants were a bit darker than his suspenders, as was a jacket he had over his shoulder. He had done a little to tame his hair, defining the part he had on the right side (same as mine) and combing it down. His shoes were old fashioned penny loafer type things. He was representing this old timey charm that I completely dug and almost couldn't deal with. I thought about literally hitting the floor, and screaming, "I'm tapping out!" Was it the imp of the perverse or was it the first time someone so attractive had ever liked me back? I decided it was both, and instead of tapping out, I waited for my parents to finish complimenting handsome Reggie on his handsome outfit, I called to him. "Reggie?"

"Mmm-hmm?" He asked, doing that thing that he kept flipping doing which was looking at me with that great face he had. 

"Will you come here for a second?" the butterflies startedhurling themselves against the inside of my stomach again.

Reggie came with me and
